  "Grapes crushed and ready for fermentation are called must. How do you hold a wine glass? There is a right and a wrong way. Red wines usually trump whites in alcohol content. Wines that are named for a region are always capitalized – Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, Rioja, Chianti, Lambrusco, etc. Chenin blanc is a white wine grape grown in the Loire Valley of France. Loamy soils, which are usually preferred for growing most plants, actually produce rather flavorless wines. Trichloroanisole in the cork can impart musty, mouldy overtones. Such a wine is called corked.",

  "The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. Chinon is a town in France renowned for its winemaking. The world's oldest person – at one hundred twenty-two – attributed her longevity to a diet of olive oil, port wine and chocolate. Bouquet refers to wine's aroma. Meat is paired well with reds.",

  "Alsace, in Eastern France, is highly regarded as a winemaking region. Well-regarded sparkling wines include Espumante from Portugal, and Asti from Italy. The concept of foie gras begs a brash blanc. Delicacy is prized in pinot noir and riesling. Hint: Sangiovese is a four syllable word. Maybe more if you're drunk.

Pursing your lips and inhaling some air while the wine is still on your palate is also a nice way to spread the more complex flavors through your sinuses. All grape juice is white, only the skins of purple grapes contain the dark pigment.",

  "Loamy soils, which are usually preferred for growing most plants, actually produce rather flavorless wines. Intense hatred of wine is called oenophobia. Strong notes of cedar, gin, with a cinnamon finish. Some wines are made from rotting grapes: Botrytis, or noble rot, makes good dessert wine. Don't be shy: wine experts stick their nose deep into the glass in order to pick up the complex nuances. Sommelier is an elegant euphemism for professional wino.",
